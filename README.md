# nanoGPT - Shakespearean Text Generation

![Shakespeare](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Shakespeare.jpg/220px-Shakespeare.jpg)

## Overview

nanoGPT is a project that leverages the power of the GPT-3.5 model to generate text in the style of William Shakespeare. By training the transformer model on Shakespearean works, we aim to produce text that emulates the language and style of the legendary playwright and poet.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Jupyter Notebook file:

- `nanoGPT.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code and steps for training the transformer model on Shakespeare's works and generating Shakespearean-like text.

## Getting Started

To get started with the nanoGPT project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nanoGPT.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd nanoGPT
   ```

3. Open the `nanoGPT.ipynb` notebook using a Jupyter Notebook environment or any Python IDE that supports Jupyter Notebooks.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and generate Shakespearean text.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

- PyTorch
- Transformers
- NLTK
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch transformers nltk pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Open the `nanoGPT.ipynb` notebook.

2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the model or generate text.
